1. The goal of the game is to have a hand value of 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over.
2. Player is dealt two cards, and the dealer is dealt one card face-up.
3. Face cards (Kings, Queens, and Jacks) have a value of 10, while numbered cards are worth their face value. Aces can be worth 1 or 11, whichever value is more advantageous for the hand.
4. Players can choose to "hit" (take another card) or "stay" (keep their current hand) in order to try to reach or get closer to 21.
5. If a player's hand exceeds 21, they "bust" and lose the game. If the dealer busts, player wins.
6. After all players have taken their turns, the dealer reveals their face-down card and must hit until their hand value is at least hard 17 or soft 18.
7. If the dealer's hand value exceeds 21, all remaining players win. Otherwise, the dealer's hand is compared to the player's hand, other higher of the two without busting wins.
8. Make bets! You win, you double what you bet, You lose, you lose what you bet.
